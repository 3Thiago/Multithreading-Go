Challanger Full Cycle API Multtheading with golang

# How to run?

cd /cmd/server/
go run main.go
```

```
{"status":429,
"ok":false,
"message":"Blocked by flood cdn",
"statusText":
"bad_request"}
```

I needed to change the second API to https://brasilapi.com.br/api/cep/v1/2524000
instead of using https://cdn.apicep.com/file/apicep/ as defined in the project scope
